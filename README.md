An object deetctor based on the Tensorflow Lite framework.
Developed and tested with an Nokia 6.1 device running Android 10.

In the static RecognitioSetting class there are some global parameters.
A user interface will be implmented later in order to set the settings
while using the app.

Also the project includes some MLKit code  for custom object recognition
but this functionality is not yet supported by the MLKit. MLkit right
not supports only custom classification, hope they will supoprt
object detection also in near future!

Have fun :)
